about R programming and your project...

R is a programming language mainly used for stats and data analysis. Think of it as the math wizard of coding.

In R, you play with libraries like tidyverse (for data cleaning and plotting), ggplot2 (for cool charts), and sometimes shiny (to make interactive apps).

The project usually has a simple structure — an R folder for all the scripts, maybe a data folder for datasets, and sometimes reports in .Rmd format (that’s like a notebook mixing code and notes).

Your code has stuff like loading data, cleaning it, making charts, running some stats or models — all neat and clear with easy-to-read syntax.

You use simple commands, like <- to assign values, library() to load packages, and plot() or ggplot() to visualize.

Basically, it’s like playing with data blocks, stacking, breaking them down, and making pretty pictures to understand what’s going on.
